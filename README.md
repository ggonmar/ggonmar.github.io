This is my first attempt to actually compose a pretty landing page for my github projects.

I'm blatantly starting off from Dinesh's project, [Dev Landing Page]

Other design I was keen on, but I'll pursue in a different manner, is the [Hyde] design, which seems to be on markup weird thing.  

Next steps are to add jquery pretty things, and have some kind of scrollable satisfying experience.   
[AOS] could be a place to start.
